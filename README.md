# GameBoy Go

A Work-In-Progress GameBoy emulator written in Golang.

This project has been recently restarted in 2022 as an educational adventure
to learn how the Game Boy works. It's not functional yet, but I'm trying to
make its development completely out in the open for others to learn from.

## How to build

```
make build
```

## How to run

```
./bin/gameboy-go -help
```
